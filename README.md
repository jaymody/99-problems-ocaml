Solutions for https://ocaml.org/problems.

I used the [Real World OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/index.html) book to learn OCaml and get my OCaml dev environment up and running.

**Dependencies**
```shell
opam install core core_bench utop ocamlformat ocaml-lsp-server
```

**Build and Run**
```shell
dune build
./_build/default/src/p01.exe  # replace with whatever problem set you wanna run
```
